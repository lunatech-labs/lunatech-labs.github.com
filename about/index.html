<h3>Rotterdam Art</h3>

<p>Displayed in our office is the work of local artists, although we are also honoured with artworks from afar.  From time to time we have exhibitions and openings, to show new talent and provide a setting that is special for guests, colleagues and partners alike. With our eclectic collection of art we can truly understand why people say art is subjective.</p>
