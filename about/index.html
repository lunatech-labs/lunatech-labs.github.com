                        <p>Lunatech Research was founded in 1993 as an IT consulting, product research and development team. As a team of adept self-managing architects and programmers, working with a very experienced commercial team, Lunatech has a successful track record of implementing medium-sized to large systems. Our skills are best applied in designing and building back office systems whereby a web interface is just one of many external user- interfaces.</p>
                    
                        <p>We excel at going into your organisation, analyzing the requirements, and then - together with you - designing and building a system to meet your needs.</p>
                        
                        <p>We work to an interactive development process. We build applications in a number of short iterations. This provides great visibility to the customer and it greatly improves the end result because the product and expectations can be adjusted along the way. With a proud record of providing professional IT services, joint ventures and investments in other peoples ideas, you'll find us highly technical, very creative, and flexible.</p>
