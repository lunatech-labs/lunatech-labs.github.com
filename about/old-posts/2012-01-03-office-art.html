<p><img src='images/office-art-vermeer.jpg' alt='Girl with a Pearl Earring' /> On Sunday June 26th 2005, we started hosting an exhibition of 20 impressions of Vermeers famous Girl with a Pearl Earring.  They were exhibited in the Lunatech Research Board Room until November 2005.  In May 2006 the Homage to Rembrant exhibition graced the walls - something a little different.  If would like to exhibit at the Lunatech offices, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
