title: "Development methodology"
summary: "For software development, we identify with the principles of Agile Software Development."
---

<p>The <a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/">manifesto</a> explains that this is to value:</p>

<ul><li><em>Individuals and interactions</em> over processes and tools</li>
<li><em>Working software</em> over comprehensive documentation</li>
<li><em>Customer collaboration</em> over contract negotiation</li>
<li><em>Responding to change</em> over following a plan.</li></ul>

<p>In particular, we use practices from <a href="http://www.scrumalliance.org/">Scrum</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Scrum is an iterative, incremental framework for developing any product or managing any work. It allows teams to deliver a potentially shippable set of functionality every iteration, providing the agility needed to respond to rapidly changing requirements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/what.html">Extreme Programming</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Extreme Programming (XP) is a deliberate and disciplined approach to software development. XP is successful because it stresses customer satisfaction. This methodology also emphasizes team work. XP improves a software project in four essential ways; communication, simplicity, feedback, and courage. XP programmers communicate with their customers and fellow programmers. They keep their design simple and clean. They get feedback by testing their software starting on day one. They deliver the system to the customers as early as possible and implement changes as suggested. With this foundation XP programmers are able to courageously respond to changing requirements and technology."</p>

<h2>Team building</h2>

<p>The working Lunch - enough can not be said for spending a few hours with your management team, or customers, and doing real-time work. Going through the issues, story-boarding, brain dumping. All with a bite to eat, and the occasional stronger beverage.</p>

<h2>Networking</h2>

<p>Be active - we are active in many business Networks. Besides looking for potential business partners, we invest time and effort in startups and young entrepreneurs so we must be out and about looking out for the best interest of our companies. This of couse also requires the occasional strong beverage and late night travel.</p>
