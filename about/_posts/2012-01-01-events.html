<h3>Bootstrapping &amp; Agility</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Bootstrapping-and-agility/">Bootstrapping and agility</a> meet-up was set-up in 2009 to bring together entrepreneurs, investors, customers and software developers to discuss how to apply bootstrap and agile techniques when starting new ventures, or software projects within established organisations. Events include management-level presentations about bootstrapping software projects. The group meets several times per year.</p>


<h3>Rotterdam art exhibitions</h3>

<p>Displayed in our office is the work of local artists, although we are also honored with works from further afield. From time to time we have exhibitions and openings, to show new talent and provide a setting that is special for guests, colleagues and partners alike. With our eclectic collection of art we truly understand why people say art is subjectiveâ€¦ If would like to exhibit at the Lunatech offices, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
