<h3>JIRA</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/">JIRA</a> is an issue tracking and project management application developed to make this process easier for your team. JIRA has been designed with a focus on task achievement, is instantly usable and is flexible to work with. By granting our customers direct access to the Lunatech JIRA, we can achieve the kind of transparency that makes project status reports unnecessary and allows our developers to spend more time writing code and less time in meetings. This is also a two-way process, since our customers can use the Lunatech JIRA to directly report bugs, submit feature requests or add comments on work in progress.</p>

<h3>Extranet</h3>

<p>The Lunatech extranet is a wiki that provides a flexible, powerful, and easy to use enterprise collaboration platform. It is typically used as a project development space, document management system and knowledge base. Web content can be created collaboratively by using just a browser.</p>
