Lunatech has been assisting companies and government for years with their electronic publishing processes. Our consultants have broad knowledge of content integration and the technologies involved in constructing successful end-user products. Our domain knowledge in the field of legal publications is extensive.

We have been advising the Dutch government, publishers and legal-offices with their content management, processing and publishing for over a decade.

## Legislation

The processes involved with the legislative processes of countries can become quite complex. We have designed and built systems that allow governments and publishers to capture and process the information forming new laws and to visualize this process for end-users.

## Case-law & jurisprudence

Every country has a steady stream of jurisprudence coming out of their courts. This raw information needs to be enriched and linked to the correct laws, and often publishers need tools to select the interesting subset for publication on- or offline. We know what is involved.

## Legal commentary

As more government information finds its way to the public domain, publishers are finding ways to enrich this information and to add value in its interpretation. This requires systems that notify your editors when the laws underlying the commentary have changed or will change.

## Content management

Lunatech recognizes that every editor and type of content has their own special needs. As an organisation however, you would like to standardize on a certain toolchain. Bridging the gap between these two apparently conflicting goals can be challenging and we have experience to do so using a mix of software tools available.

Amongst others we can deliver expertise regarding popular content management systems such as Hippo, Alfresco and Tridion.

## Content processing
Tying the information from disparate content management systems together into one cohesive set of information for your customers and end-user products can be challenging.

Furthermore, you may want to enrich your meta-data, perhaps using automatic classification schemes, and produce content in suitable formats such as XML, XHTML, PDF or even e-books. For years we have done exactly that.

## Content publishing

You know your content and what it stands for. Opening up your information to your end-users is another matter; Lunatech has extensive experience in building successful end-user applications, from functional design to implementation. We can determine how your customers want to view your content and also know the search and index engines that support this.

We have experience with Oracle, Autonomy (Verity) and most open source engines such as Lucene, PostgreSQL and Hippo.

Furthermore we can help publishers make the jump to the world of web services, where your customers expect tighter integration between their systems with yours.
