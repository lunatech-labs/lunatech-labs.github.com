## Consultancy

The Play framework promotes and integrates beautifully with a RESTful service-oriented architecture. We can help you design an elegant architecture, reuse your existing services and build rock-solid RESTful web services and applications.

If you are starting a Play project, we can advise you on the best way to tackle it, and put you on the right track.

We can also assist you in making sure Play fits the way you work. If you also want to integrate your Play application with your existing Java EE service stack, but you don't really know how, just ask us. We have a Work! toolbox that can help.

## Technical training

Play offers flexibility and agility in the Java world. The goal of this training course is to teach your development team how to exploit this flexibility and agility. They will be studying best practices and how to become agile and flexible.

This intermediate-level two-day training course targets developers and architects who want to learn more about the specifics and internals of the framework. Java and web development knowledge is a pre-requisite.

## Support

We can provide expert developer support for the Play framework, with an SLA for developer questions, framework bug fixing and enhancements. Contact us for more information.

We can develop custom Play modules, as well as enhancements to the framework itself. We have already contributed several of the Play modules that are available on playframework.org.
