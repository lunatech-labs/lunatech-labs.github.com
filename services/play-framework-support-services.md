Lunatech is a [Typesafe consultancy partner](http://typesafe.com/company/partners), 
and provides consultancy and training to help you with your Play projects.

## Consultancy

The Play framework promotes and integrates beautifully with a RESTful
service-oriented architecture. We can help you design an elegant architecture,
reuse your existing services and build rock-solid RESTful web services and
applications.

If you are starting a Play project, we can advise you on the best way to tackle
it, and put you on the right track.

We can also assist you in making sure Play fits the way you work. If you also
want to integrate your Play application with your existing Java EE service
stack, but you don't really know how, just ask us. We have a Work! toolbox that
can help.

## Technical training

Although Lunatechâ€™s focus is on development projects and consultancy, we
occasionally offer training. Lunatech Play framework training consists of
practical courses that in which developers benefit from our expertise and
practical experience of using Play on commercial projects and learn how to build
a web application with Play.

## Books

As well as development projects, several Lunatech staff have used their Play
expertise to write two Play framework books for Manning Publications.
