title: Project delivery
summary: Lunatech has a long track record of successful project delivery, based on small and effective teams of self-managing software developers. Our senior developers combine their technical expertise with technical project management experience, which allows Lunatech to deliver projects more efficiently, with less management overhead.

Our philosophy of managed risk and incremental software development is fully-aligned with modern [agile software development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) practices. In particular, we use [Scrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)) where appropriate.

## Project visibility

Instead of spending project management effort on producing weekly and monthly project status reports, we use web-based tools to provide our clients with real-time visibility of project status. Our clients can see overall progress at a glance, and can drill-down to the status of individual assigned development tasks.

This provides the kind of transparency that makes project status reports unnecessary and allows our developers to spend more time writing code and less time in meetings.

JIRA is an issue tracking and project management application developed to make this process easier for your team. We grant our customers direct access to the Lunatech JIRA.

## Managed project risk
Custom business software development is inherently risky, due to the explorative nature of business and software development teams collaborating on an innovative business solution.

Lunatech helps you manage that risk by keeping the initial (financial) commitment small, and making ongoing project progress contingent on demonstrating both the feasibility of the business solution and our ability to successfully deliver the software implementation.

For example, a typical project will deliver a fully-working subset of the final system within twenty per cent of the project budget. This milestone gives the project an opportunity to prove itself early-on, or fail early rather than succeed at any cost.

## On-budget delivery

Many IT projects fail because the vendorâ€™s sales team deliberately under-priced the total project cost, knowing that when the planned time and budget runs out, their customer will be forced to accept a 50-100 per cent project overrun.

Although businesses would benefit from projects with a fixed price and schedule, this is usually not what they get, to any reasonable degree of confidence or value for money.

Lunatech's project delivery approach prevents this problem: by only committing our customer to a small part of the project and its budget, we avoid runaway cost over-runs. At the same time, we are confident of our ability to successfully deliver on-time and within budget, ensuring that we ultimately deliver the whole project.
