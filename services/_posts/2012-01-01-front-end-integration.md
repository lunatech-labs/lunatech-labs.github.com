<p class="infographic-nodejs-text"><strong>Lunatech &amp; Node.js</strong>: Node.js already has a presence withing the Java community as it drives many development tools. As part of the stack, we can make use of it. Templating on the back- &amp; front-end anybody?
    <br><br>
    <strong>Pro</strong>: Web developers can usually deal with the entire stack. <br>
    <strong>Con</strong>: Requires that the team designs a stable and scalable architecture and sticks to it.
</p>
<p class="infographic-jsf-text"><strong>Lunatech &amp; component-based frameworks</strong>: RichFaces, ICEfaces and other JavaServer Faces 'enhancements' are still being used in many enterprise solutions. their front-end technology is effectively a black box and obscured from the developer.<br><br>
    <strong>Pro</strong>: Java developers can usually deal with the entire stack. <br>
    <strong>Con</strong>: Near zero customisation options as you're locked out from the front-end.
</p>
<p class="infographic-angular-text"><strong>Lunatech &amp; client-based MVC frameworks</strong>: There is no denying that JavaScript is here to stay and is being improved at a rapid rate. By using mature server based services and moving logic to the browser, we can have the best of both worlds.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Pro</strong>: Specialists can quickly develop within their own technology and do this in parallel. <br>
    <strong>Con</strong>: Projects can become complicated over time, as logic changes and both the server and the front-end end up fighting over the mark-up.
</p>
<p class="infographic-app-text"><strong>The application</strong>: No matter the technology, customer needs must be met. Picking a technology can have significant impact on development, especially when we rely on specific resources. </p>
<p class="infographic-java-text"><strong>Mature technology</strong>: Java and .NET are considered mature in that they are stable and well understood by their communities. No excitement, just steady as she goes. </p>
<p class="infographic-js-text"><strong>The web</strong>: The web itself is still growing and the technology that drives it even more so. JavaScript is the de facto language of the browser and making great strides on the server via Node.js. It may be a fashion, but it sure is a popular one.</p>

Lunatech understands the need for multidisciplinary software development, with decades of experience in building and integrating enterprise level applications.

We have expanded our expertise in front-end technology to be able to deal with a variety of user experience (UX) requirements:

* corporate identity
* usability
* accessibility (Dutch Web Guidelines)
* multi platform solutions.

Our longstanding technical expertise in performance, durability, maintainability and availability go hand in hand with creating and extending what users get to see, touch and use. Our front-end work includes:

* custom templating
* marketing solutions on custom or branded websites via CSS and HTML.
* extending behaviour and adding features to applications and e-commerce websites via JavaScript.
* rapid web development within enterprise environments.


## From component-based UI to custom UX

End user exposure to an ever-increasing variety of quality software requires that new software needs to reflect a certain identity and with it a certain level of attention to detail to the user interface. Component-based systems cannot provide this flexibility and their component frameworks usually obscure the front-end from the developer to simplify development. However, identity (branding) and user experience (UX) require the front-end code to be accessible and flexible, even if the changes are minor.

Software, web applications in particular, have been evolving to cater to more diverse and sophisticated end users. Component based framework technology like JSF still has its place as it is focussed on leveraging resources usually available within enterprise environments. 

The shift of expectations by stakeholders of what software can deliver brings up a number of issues with mature component based solutions and the restricted interfaces these systems provide.
