Lunatech understands the need for multidisciplinary software development, with decades of experience in building and integrating enterprise level applications.

We have expanded our expertise in front-end technology to be able to deal with a variety of user experience (UX) requirements:

* corporate identity
* usability
* accessibility (Dutch Web Guidelines)
* multi platform solutions.

Our longstanding technical expertise in performance, durability, maintainability and availability go hand in hand with creating and extending what users get to see, touch and use. Our front-end work includes:

* custom templating
* marketing solutions on custom or branded websites via CSS and HTML.
* extending behaviour and adding features to applications and e-commerce websites via JavaScript.
* rapid web development within enterprise environments.


## From component-based UI to custom UX

End user exposure to an ever-increasing variety of quality software requires that new software needs to reflect a certain identity and with it a certain level of attention to detail to the user interface. Component-based systems cannot provide this flexibility and their component frameworks usually obscure the front-end from the developer to simplify development. However, identity (branding) and user experience (UX) require the front-end code to be accessible and flexible, even if the changes are minor.

Software, web applications in particular, have been evolving to cater to more diverse and sophisticated end users. Component based framework technology like JSF still has its place as it is focussed on leveraging resources usually available within enterprise environments. 

The shift of expectations by stakeholders of what software can deliver brings up a number of issues with mature component based solutions and the restricted interfaces these systems provide.
