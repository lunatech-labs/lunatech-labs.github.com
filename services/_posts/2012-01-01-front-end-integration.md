The end users exposure to an ever increasing variety of quality software requires that new software needs to reflect a certain identity and with it a certain level of attention to detail to the User Interface that component based systems can't provide. Component frameworks usually obscure the front-end from the developer to simplify development. However, Identity (branding) and User Experience (UX) requires the front-end code to be accessible and flexible, even if the changes are minor.

Software, web applications in particular have been evolving to cater to more diverse and sophisticated end users. 
Component based framework technology like JSF still has its place as it is focussed on leveraging resources usually available within enterprise environments. 
The shift of expectations by stakeholders of what software can deliver brings up a number of issues with mature component based solutions and the restricted interfaces these systems provide.
