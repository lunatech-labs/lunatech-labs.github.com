Team extension is increasing a team’s capabilities in a specific expertise. Team extension is not about simply growing the size of a team, but rather about increasing the team’s effectiveness without reducing its efficiency. This is achieved by adding an expert to an existing team, within a clear context of roles, responsibilities, process and deliverables.

The expertise might be in a:

* specific technology, e.g. the [Play Framework](play-framework-support-services) or [JBoss Rules](jboss-rules-implementation) (a.k.a. Drools)
* technical role, e.g. user-experience design, web services architecture
* software development role, e.g. [Scrum Master](interim-scrum-master), Scrum Product Owner, functional designer.

Optionally, team extension can involve knowledge transfer so that the team acquires the new capability and is not dependent on an external expert in the long term.

## Goals

The goals of team extension are to:

* relate the new expertise to existing business goals
* bootstrap introduction of a new expertise area within an existing team
* deliver the benefits of the new expertise to the project results
* reduce project risk associated with new techniques.

When knowledge transfer is included, an additional goal is frictionless knowledge acquisition by an existing team who will himself become an expert in the long term.

## Roles and responsibilities

The scope of team extension is defined by the expert’s project roles. The expert works together with project management and technical management as an enabler, actively coaching and supporting the team.

Lunatech’s expert should not lead the team, because this would result in more dependency on the expert over time, instead of less.

The expert's responsibilities include providing the project and technical leads with relevant information so they can make informed decisions related to the area of expertise. The expert will agree success factors for effectively adding capabilities to the existing team.
