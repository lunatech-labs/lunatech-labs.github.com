We believe technology does make a difference in creating successful software. Therefore Lunatech prides itself in being technologically innovative. We have smiling and friendly developers that can extend your in-house development team or that run projects by themselves.

![Play](images/play.png)

The Play framework represents a new approach to building Java web applications that challenges Java EE’s conventions and complexity, reducing time needed to build scalable web applications. Play! offers many of PHP’s advantages, while using the Java language and offering full access to the stability of established Java libraries. We are active contributors to the framework, offering a high level of expertise. [Read More…](play-framework-support-services)

![jBPM](images/jbpm.png)

For modeling and automating complex business processes we use JBoss Rules (Drools) or jBPM (JBoss Business Process Management). Each of these frameworks provides powerful tools that enable IT projects to manage the business logic embedded in software applications, making it possible to develop, test and maintain the software more effectively at lower cost.

![Scala](images/scala.png)

Scala is a next-generation object-oriented programming language that runs in the Java Virtual Machine and integrates with the Java platform. Scala introduces functional programming features and improved type safety, which makes it possible to write shorter and more expressive code. We are interested in Scala's potential to improve development speed and software reliability

![XML](images/xml.png)

We have handled documents and information-flows for years and therefore are experts when it comes to XML, how to process it and how to store it. Several Lunatech consultants are wizards at gathering specifications and turning these into well functioning XSL-Transformations for messaging and on- or offline publishing.

![Alfresco](images/alfresco.png)

Alfresco is an open source Enterprise Content Management (ECM) system that provides powerful standard-based content management, collaboration and work-flow. We are interested in using Alfresco's potential to displace proprietary document management, content management and collaboration platforms in large organisations.
