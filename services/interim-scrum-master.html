Lunatech has years of agile software development experience, completing projects with small agile teams that regularly deliver software as part of an iterative approach. Our Scrum masters are senior software developers, who bring their technical skills to the development team and contribute to the development effort, as well as co-ordinating the Scrum process and facilitating communication with the product owner and other stakeholders.

<h2 id="experts">Scrum experts</h2>

<p>Starting any new software development project is always a difficult proposition. Starting with a new team only makes it harder, and introducing a new software development method such as Scrum adds further risk. Scrum's evolving iterative approach addresses this risk, but it takes time to get started, especially for teams that lack Scrum experience. We can provide the Scrum expert who will reduce this initial risk.</p>

<h2 id="interim">Interim experts</h2>

<p>Starting your Scrum project with an interim Scrum master reduces initial project risk, by making Scrum expertise available from the start, while avoiding long-term dependency on a third-party supplier. As your Scrum process evolves to match your people and projects, the Scrum master develops valuable knowledge of how to successfully apply Scrum within your organisation. You need this knowledge to remain in-house; your medium-term goal is always to hand-over the Scrum Master role to a member of your own staff.</p>
