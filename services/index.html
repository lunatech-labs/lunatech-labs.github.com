                        <p>Lunatech has a long track record of successful project delivery, based on small and effective teams of self-managing software developers. Our senior developers combine their technical expertise with technical project management experience, which allows Lunatech to deliver projects more efficiently, with less management overhead.</p>
                    
                        <h3>System integration solutions</h3>
                        <p>
                           System integration needs a broad range of skills and is likely to be defined by a breadth of knowledge rather than a depth of knowledge. These skills are likely to include software and hardware engineering, interface protocols, and general problem solving skills. It is likely that the problems to be solved have not been solved before except in the broadest sense. They are likely to include new and challenging problems with an input from a broad range of engineers where the system integration engineer needs to "pulls it all together". Lunatech makes it happen.</p>
