summary: This month we are launching the first 010DEV event, a new social-tech event for software developers. The goal of 010DEV is to create a vibrant software development community in the Rotterdam area. Our first event includes a hard-core technical presentation by Trisha Gee, a less serious presentation by Peter Hilton, and plenty of free* beer.
