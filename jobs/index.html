<h2>Who we are looking for</h2>
<p>Candidates should be <a href="http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/generalizingSpecialists.htm">generalising specialists</a>, well motivated, adept at multi-tasking and be willing to take on some management responsibility for projects. Good communication in Dutch and English, spoken as well as written is a requirement. Being a naturally gifted IT prodigy certainly would be a premium. For our Java developer roles, we are looking for things like:</p>
<ul class="check-list">
<li>good object-oriented design and implementation skills</li>
<li>experience using Java EE technologies (Play framework and JBoss open-source technologies are a plus)</li>
<li>knowledge of relational databases and SQL (Oracle or PostgreSQL is a plus)</li>
<li>practical experience with XML, XSLT and XML-related tools and programming methodologies</li>
<li>experience in working with Unix-based systems</li>
<li>skills in modern front-end development using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript</li>
<li>affinity with the open-source programming mind set</li>
<li>people who are used to agile software development.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What itâ€™s like to work here</h2>
<p>As an experienced and talented software developer, there are plenty of other smart, agile and productive development teams you could work with. However, some of what it means to be a programmer at Lunatech is unique.</p>
<ul>
<li>All Lunatech staff (except the director) write code: we are software developers first, and cover all of the other roles and responsibilities according to our interests and skills. In particular, we do not employ non-coding project managers; instead, a senior developer takes on project management responsibility for each project.</li>
<li>We do half of our work in our own office - the perfect working environment for writing code, rather than on client-site. Developers work 1-4 people to a room; it is quiet most of the time. We all have plenty of space, powerful workstations, two big monitors each, and a really good coffee machine. We are very productive.</li>
<li>We assign employees a maximum of four days per week to a customer location, so they still have time to work from the office, and the freedom to develop and use their initiative and creativity (to learn, and build cool stuff).</li>
<li>We have an informal working environment when we work in our office, because it is easier to work hard if you are comfortable. Jeans are fine if that's your thing, although half of us prefer to dress smart-casual; no-one wears a suit or tie. We like to relax at the end of the day, after work; we keep the fridge stocked with beer and wine. Our building is an old town house with a kitchen, terrace, garden and roof-terrace.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, Lunatech's culture, organisation, working environment and business model are designed by programmers for programmers. We are fortunate that this supports a profitable business model that makes this sustainable.</p>
