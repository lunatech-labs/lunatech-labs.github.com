### Working for Lunatech

Lunatech, founded in 1993, has had yet another great year of building web sites and applications. Having completed large projects building modern desktop and mobile (web)applications we're looking for a young front-end developer to help our developers integrate design in to future websites and applications. 

You'll be creating front-end for (mobile)websites and applications from scratch as well as adapting current projects to meet today's standards. You'll get room to grow to help us with design and creating UI widgets. 


### What we are looking for

* Strong skills in CSS, HTML and JavaScript
* Knowledge of web stack libraries like jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap etc.
* Passionate about web standards and usability
* Up-to-date in current techniques like adaptive web design
* Ability to communicate with developers and designers on how front-end is implemented
* Current on upcoming developments in front-end technology.
* Proficient in written and spoken English.


### What we are offering

We're situated in a beautiful building on the Heemraadsingel in Rotterdam. Our colleagues from all around the world make it a very relaxed atmosphere to work in. 
You get set up your own working environment. Most us work on MacBook Pro's, but the choice is yours.
You will get to work on projects small (fun) and large (challenging).
Learning is encouraged and actively supported.
