### Working for Lunatech

Lunatech, founded in 1993, has had yet another great year of building web sites and applications. Having completed large projects building modern desktop and mobile (web) applications we’re looking for a young front-end developer to help our developers integrate design in to our web sites and applications. 

You’ll be creating the front-end for (mobile) web sites and applications from scratch as well as adapting current projects to meet today’s standards. You’ll get room to grow by designing and creating new user interfaces from a code and usability point of view. 


### What we are looking for

* Strong skills in CSS, HTML and JavaScript
* Knowledge of web stack libraries like jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap etc.
* Passionate about web standards and usability
* Up-to-date in current techniques like adaptive web design
* Ability to communicate with developers and designers on how front-end is implemented
* Current on upcoming developments in front-end technology.
* Proficient in written and spoken English.


### What we are offering

We’re situated in a beautiful building on the Heemraadsingel in Rotterdam. Our colleagues from all around the world make it a very relaxed atmosphere to work in.

You get to set up your own working environment. Most us work on MacBook Pros, but the choice is yours. You will get to work on projects small (fun) and large (challenging). Learning is encouraged and actively supported. Being good at what you do is important to us.
