summary: "We have a vacancy for a smart ambitious web developer to join our team of serious coders who build web applications for ambitious custom development projects."
---

<p>At Lunatech, every team member writes code and cares about using the right technology and using it well. You won’t work for a project manager in a suit who doesn't write code because we don't have any of those: senior developers have part-time responsibility for running agile software development.</p>

<h3 id="skills">Your skills</h3>

<ul>
<li>Writing good code that other programmers respect you for</li>
<li>Learning so fast that you can use better technology every time</li>
<li>Building web applications using modern web frameworks</li>
<li>Java, Scala and JavaScript skills</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="nice">Nice to have</h3>

<p>Everyone writes web application and web services code, but you can be more useful by having additional skills that not everyone has (or has to have).</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing skills</li>
<li>Front-end design</li>
<li>Devops and cloud deployment</li>
</ul>

<p>We’re looking for someone who is smart and gets things done, with additional skills that broaden the team in unexpected ways.</p>

<h3 id="job">Your job</h3>

<p>Successful applicants will work in a productive environment with excellent tools, a diverse team and as much freedom and responsibility as you can handle. You will write code using IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse on a new MacBook Pro that runs on Ubuntu servers. You will build applications with Java, Scala, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, JQuery, Backbone, Play framework and similar.</p>

<p>Unsuccessful applicants will probably end up working on-site for 40 hours per week, wearing a tie and using Windows on a second-hand Dell laptop.</p>
