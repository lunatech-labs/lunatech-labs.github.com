title: "Front-end developer vacancy"
summary: "Lunatech has a vacancy for an expert front-end developer with a vision for designing and building client-side web applications using web standards and open-source software."
---

<p>While the core of Lunatech's work is large applications based on open-source Java EE stacks, usually with a web-based user-interface, we are increasingly involved in projects to build pure web applications. At the same time, web standards such as HTML5 allow for increasingly-sophisticated web application user-interfaces, demanding correspondingly sophisticated design and front-end development skills.</p>
<p>These applications focus more on user-interaction and visual design, and delegate data processing and business logic to other server-side systems, via web services and shared databases.</p>
<p>To help us build these kinds of applications, we are looking for a front-end developer who is an expert in:</p>
<ul class="check-list">
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>jQuery</li>
<li>HTML5</li>
<li>CSS 3.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are looking for someone who is a programmer first and a designer second, because the work is more about jQuery and HTTP than it is about Photoshop and graphic design. Although Java programming experience is not required, you will be working with Java-based server technologies. The ideal candidate is:</p>
<ul class="check-list">
<li>passionate about the web</li>
<li>up-to-date in current issues in web design</li>
<li>creative and able to produce both derivative and innovative</li>
<li>able to explain front-end design to back-end systems developers</li>
<li>following the people currently on the cutting-edge of web standards development.</li>
</ul>
<p>All staff take on delivery responsibility, and our senior developers manage our development projects, instead of non-coding project managers.</p>
<p>In addition, we are looking for a useful combination of skills and experience with things like:</p>
<ul class="check-list">
<li>Ajax and JSON</li>
<li>user-interaction design</li>
<li>user-centred design and testing</li>
<li>web-based usability and accessibility</li>
<li>mobile application design</li>
<li>graphic design</li>
<li>web development frameworks such as PHP, Ruby on Rails, Grails or the Play framework</li>
<li>comfortable working in OS X or Linux.</li>
</ul>
<p>Salary range: â‚¬30-50K depending on experience and ability to take on technical project management responsibilities.</p>
