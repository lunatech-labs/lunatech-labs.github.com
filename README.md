# lunatech-labs.github.com - GitHub pages prototype

## Basics

* Generated files can be viewed locally with working CSS and JavaScripts.
* Generated files contain links with absolute URLs that only work online.
* Files and directories whose names donâ€™t start with an underscore are copied to the generated site.
* Files that start with a [YAML Front-Matter](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/YAML-Front-Matter) section are processed by the [Liquid templating system](https://github.com/shopify/liquid/wiki/liquid-for-designers) and have [Jekyll template data](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/template-data) available.
* Processed files can specify their target URL with a `permalink` variable.
* Markdown files are rendered as HTML.
* Generated files have `.html` extensions, but the site (and its links) uses URLs without an extension (which presumably works because of the Github Pages web server configuration).
