                    <p>Lunatech Research was founded in 1993 as an IT consulting, product research and development team. As a team of adept self-managing architects and programmers, working with a very experienced commercial team, Lunatech has a successful track record of implementing medium-sized to large systems. Our skills are best applied in designing and building back office systems whereby a web interface is just one of many external user- interfaces.</p>

                    <p>We excel at going into your organisation, analyzing the requirements, and then - together with you - designing and building a system to meet your needs.</p>
                    <p>We work to an interactive development process. We build applications in a number of short iterations. This provides great visibility to the customer and it greatly improves the end result because the product and expectations can be adjusted along the way. With a proud record of providing professional IT services, joint ventures and investments in other peoples ideas, you'll find us highly technical, very creative, and flexible.</p>

					<h3>Rotterdam Art</h3>
					
					<p>Displayed in our office is the work of local artists, although we are also honoured with artworks from afar.  From time to time we have exhibitions and openings, to show new talent and provide a setting that is special for guests, colleagues and partners alike. With our eclectic collection of art we can truly understand why people say art is subjective.</p>

					<h3>Rotterdam Events</h3>
					
					<p>Lunatech has a keen interest in making Rotterdam an even more attractive and businesslike environment.  Working through different projects, we like to interact with the local community and participate where we can be of help.  Donating to good causes is something we are proud to do. Of course, we are a "networking company" and are to be found at interesting events in the city.</p>
