                <p>We only invest in early stage ventures that need funds to build their product. We do not provide growth capital. We like risk and we love the rewards!</p></td>

                <p>As you are pre-revenue and may or may not have a prototype or MVP, it is hard to put a value on your efforts. Obviously one day you'll be worth millions but for now you value yourself at EUR 500.000 or less.</p>
