YOUR VENTURE

You are just starting
You are an early stage venture ready to rock the world. You know what it is you want to start building and may or may not have started already.

OUR APPROACH

We provide seed investment
We only invest in early stage ventures that need funds to build their product. We do not provide growth capital. We like risk and we love the rewards!

You have done your analysis
The idea is unique and refreshing, and has a strong competitive edge. You know why you are going to conquer the market whereas others have failed.

We invest for equity
We are not a bank. Yes, we want a piece of the action. Initially we expect 20% - 30% in equity. We are willing to engineer our exit up front at a predetermined value.

You have a solid team
The key skills required to start the business are all represented in your team. You have a strong entrepreneur and someone with a commercial focus. Everyone in your team is committed to run for at least the next three years.

We have limits
We can help you develop your product and refine your vision, but we do not want to run your company, that's what you do. Furthermore, we like simple solutions.

Your valuation is reasonable
As you are pre-revenue and may or may not have a prototype or MVP, it is hard to put a value on your efforts. Obviously one day you'll be worth millions but for now you value yourself at EUR 500.000 or less.

We get involved
Whether Lunatech contributes technically or not, we will always get involved with our unwanted advice. We have vast experience in bootstrapping companies and will help you plot a pragmatic course to success.

You are Continental
Naturally your aspirations are global, but for now you have your base of operations in Europe, or have real plans of moving there.

We like West- and Eastcoast
We are based in The Netherlands and work best with ventures we can have a beer with.
