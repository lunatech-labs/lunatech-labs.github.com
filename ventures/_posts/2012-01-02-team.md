                    One of the benefits we enjoy comes from our team of experienced software architects we have available to assist us. During our due diligence phase and after investment quite often these engineers assist us. They provide technology leadership to less experienced team members, oversees architecture, design and development of the most complex elements of internal and external applications. They often work to an interactive development process, something we feel is extremely important during the start-up phases of companies.
