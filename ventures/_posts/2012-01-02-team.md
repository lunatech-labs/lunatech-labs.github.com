                <p>
                    Lunatech Labs designs, builds and delivers custom software and/or bespoke applications. Lunatech Research provides the technical due diligence for Lunatech Ventures. Lunatech works to an interactive development process, something we feel is extremely important during the start-up phases of companies. Lunatech provides technology leadership to less experienced team members, oversees architecture, design and development of the most complex elements of internal and external applications.
