    Play framework books by Lunatech: Play for Scala and Play for Java
summary: |
    Much as we’d like to build everything, we know that you can get more done if you help other people to do it for themselves. Knowledge transfer isn’t just about working with our customer’s developers and training them: we also write. Lunatech staff have used their Play Framework expertise to produce two books about Play 2 for Manning Publications, in addition to their active contributions to the open-source project.

## Play for Scala

Play for Scala shows you how to build web applications in Scala using Play 2, the new de-facto standard web application development framework for Scala.

Readers need this book because despite the rising popularity of Scala as a post-Java language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), none of the existing web frameworks have captured the attention of mainstream web developers.

Play first achieved this for Java web developers in the two years since Play 1.0’s October 2009 release, and added fully-integrated Scala support in 2012. Since then, Play 2 has put Scala on equal footing with Java, making Play a true Scala web application development framework.

## Play for Java

Play for Java shows you how to build web applications in Java using Play 2, highlighting the benefits over conventional Java frameworks and popular frameworks for dynamic languages.

The purpose of this book is to explain that web development does not need to be complex: simplicity is at the core of Play. The book explains all aspects of the Play framework, and can serve as a complete tutorial as well as a reference book.

The book addresses JEE developer concerns, and demonstrates that a stateless web application can fit in an enterprise environment. It shows the productivity bonuses one can get from using Play.
